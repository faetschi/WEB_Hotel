            <h2>Accommodation – Searching</h2> 
            <h3>How do I search for a suitable hotel or apartment for my stay?</h3> 
            <p>
                It is very easy. At first type (enter) name of your destination/hotel including
                date of your stay into the blue "Search box". 
                Than just click on red button "Search". 
                Immediately, all the available rooms will show up including prices for whole stay (number of nights you filled previously). 
                You can also use our filters for more specific accommodation request as price per room, star rating, hotel type, facilities etc. 
                On the top of the page you can also sort the accommodation based on popularity, price per room, guest rating and distance from center. 
                You can also select a suitable accommodation on the map located on our home page - all hotels are listed there together with all the main attractions. 
                This is quite helpful if you do not know the destination much but wish to stay close to a certain attraction.
            </p>
        <h2>Accommodation – Type of rooms / Facilities / Services</h2>
            <h3>How do I get to know which facilities / services each hotel offers??</h3> 
            <p>
                Please, have a look at the section Hotel basic information. 
                In this section you will also find the check in/out information. 
                Hotel facilities / services are stated in Hotel basic information, 
                just below the the offer of available rooms.

                Please note, that some of the facilities might be off-site and also for extra charge.
            </p>    
        <h2>Booking process</h2>
            <h3>How do I book accommodation?</h3>
                <p>
            Booking is possible only by completing the reservation form on our web site. Please, select the dates of your stay and type of rooms you have chosen. The system will show you the price for the accommodation (always check the room conditions). If you agree with the total price and the booking conditions, just click on red button "Book now" and the reservation form will show up. Once you finish the order form and click on button "Book now", your reservation will be confirmed shorty to your email address.
                </p>
            <h3>How do I know that my reservation is confirmed?</h3>
                <p>
                After completing and sending us your order form, you will get an automatic receipt e-mail containing your order number. Within 30 minutes, you will receive Accommodation confirmation. The Accommodation confirmation serves you as a voucher so please do not forget to print it out and take it with you as it contains all the vital details (address of your hotel, contact phone numbers and other instructions). In case that you requested in your order form any special requests – ie. extra bed, non smoking room, parking etc, please always double check with the hotel directly that they noted your request and are able to arrange it for you.
                </p>
            <h3>Can I book your services by telephone, e-mail or fax?</h3>
                <p>
                Unfortunately not. If you wish to make a booking, please fill in the order form on our website.
                </p>
            <h3>I made a reservation but did not receive any confirmation. What should I do?</h3>
                <p>
                Before finalizing your reservation please double check your e-mail address because a mistake in the e-mail address is the most common reason why our clients do not receive their confirmations. In some cases, our e-mails can also end up in the “spam folder” so please check it as well. In any case, please try to contact us by e-mail as we will be very happy to assist you and solve the problem as soon as possible.
                How many rooms can I book at once?
                You can book as many rooms as are available for selected period.
                </p>  
        <h2>Change of a booking / Cancellation</h2>
            <h3>How do I cancel my booking?</h3>
                <p>
                Please click on the link provided in the Accommodation confirmation and cancel your reservation.
                </p>
            <h3>How do I know that my reservation is cancelled?</h3>
                <p>
                When your reservation is cancelled, you will get a cancellation confirmation from us. If you don’t hear back from us in 30 minutes, please get in touch with us by some other means (e-mail).
                </p>    
            <h3>What cancellation conditions do you have? When at latest can I change the booking without being charged any fee?</h3>
                <p>
                Each room has its own cancellation policy and for this information always check the room conditions. Generally, your reservation can be canceled or changed few days before your arrival. However, there are some exceptions - for example „Non Refundable“ or „Special conditions“ rooms. You can check the room policy if you click on the room type.
                </p>
            <h3>My credit card has been charged by the hotel though I changed/cancelled my reservation in time. How can I get a refund?</h3>
                <p>
                Please, contact the hotel directly – all the cancellation fees are debited directly by hotels and only they can refund you any amount.
                </p>
            <h3>Do the payment and cancellation conditions for group reservations or long-term stays differ?</h3>
                <p>
                Yes, they do, however you will be informed about all the conditions of your booking before you commit to make a fixed booking.
